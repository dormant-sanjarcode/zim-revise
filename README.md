# zim-revise
A simple Zim-wiki plugin for revising notes.

For each page in the index section, two things are added:
1. A checkbox
2. An optional textarea for writing a message.

How to do this - have a file that stores revision progress.

Important:
* If all subpages are marked, the root page is marked.
* The revision file is not part of the notebook.
* Editing the notebook updates the revision file.
* The revision file can be exported.
